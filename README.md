# David's GNU/Linux Dotfiles
Forked from [Luke's GNU/Linux Dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice)

## Programs whose configs can be found here

+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ Xresourses info used by [Luke's](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st) as a terminal
+ vim
+ bash
+ ranger (see full documentation [here](.config/ranger/david_ranger_readme.md))
+ ~~mutt/msmtp/offlineimap~~
+ calcurse
+ ncmpcpp and mpd (my main music player)
+ mpv
+ neofetch
+ And many little scripts I use filed in the `~/.scripts/` directory

## More documentation

There's a full .pdf write-up of the repository.

Or, if you actually installed my dotfiles, you can just press `Super+F1` to
show the same document offline.

The command `getkeys` will also show basic key binds for different programs.

## Dynamic Configuration Files

Store your favorite or high-traffic directories in `~/.bmdirs` or your most
important config files in `~/.bmfiles` with keyboard shortcuts. When you add
things to theses files my vimrc will automatically run `shortcuts` which will
dynamically generate shortcuts for these in bash, ranger and optionally
qutebrowser and fish.

# "Dependencies" and programs used
